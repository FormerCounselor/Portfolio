# 3D Printer Primer

This document is intended for absolute beginners to the world of 3D printing. 

#### *Why This Document is Necessary*

For the novice, documents about an introduction to 3D printing are largely unintelligible. They require lots of time and effort spent merely to be able to comprehend. Yet, it is entirely possible to purchase a simple printer, never modify it, and get perfectly usable results. 

General Printer Terms

The type of 3D printer that will best suit your needs depends on the model being made. Models, commonly called prints, are the object that the printer creates. The terms model and print may be used interchangeably in the document.

Printers use a program called a slicer. A slicer program takes the print, converts it into hundreds of tiny layers, and creates one of two types of instruction files that the printer can understand. The height of those layers is dependent on the resolution of the printer.

Resolution is just like it is in pictures and video, only there is an added third dimension. Instead of pixels, resolution is typically measured in micrometers (microns). One millimeter contains 1000 microns. 

The Z resolution is the layer height, but think of it as just the height. The XY resolution determines how small details on the print can be, and XY can be compared to length and width. 

A model is constructed on a build plate. A build plate is a flat surface, made with durable material, the dimensions of which represent the printer’s build volume. The build volume also includes the Z, or vertical dimension, which is unique to the printer. Build volumes are measured in millimeters. The build plate sits on top of the printer’s bed. The bed is an adjustable platform that moves back and forth during construction. 

Supports are used by both types of printers. Supports are just what they sound like: they help stabilize the print during the 3D printing process, ensuring the print is constructed accurately. The important thing to know is that sometimes supports are necessary for a print. However,  determining if supports are necessary is beyond the scope of this document.  

Consumer Level Printers

Two Types of Printers of 3D printers available to consumers. They are Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Stereolithography (SLA). FFF is commonly known as FDM, but that term is trademarked.
Fused Filament Fabrication

How it Works

FFF printers use filament to create the model. Filament is a type of plastic that is melted and pushed through a nozzle. Nozzles have different sized openings at the tip, but are interchangeable. The size of the opening at the tip limits the amount of filament that can pass. Nozzles also conduct heat provided by a heating element, which melts the filament to the proper temperature. The rate at which the filament is pushed through the nozzle is controlled by the extruder. 

Unboxing and Assembly

FFF printers come partially assembled. Partially assembled means that the printer comes as several longer pieces, and assembly must be completed after purchase. If you need additional help beyond the instructions, there are many Youtube videos available that are comprehensive walkthroughs of the entire assembly process. 

Preparation - Before Printing

Some printer pros have their own elaborate tricks, and highly customized setups. But, there are commonalities in most of these processes to ensure a clean print. Place your model’s file into the slicer software of your choice, orient the model as desired, then slice the file. The slicer generates an instruction file. Load the sliced file onto an SD card, and insert that card into the printer. Clean the build plate with Isopropyl alcohol, commonly known as IPA, and wipe it with a clean, lint-free cloth. Pre-heat the nozzle to the manufacturer’s recommended temperature for the filament, and pre-heat the build plate to the recommended temperature so that the print will stick to the surface. 

Level the build plate. It is important to level the build plate AFTER it is at printing temperature, as leveling before heat expansion can result in a flawed print. A build plate must be leveled with respect to the printer’s frame, not the surface the printer is resting on. Select the model’s instruction file loaded onto the SD card from earlier, then print.

Troubleshooting

Keep your FFF printer unmodified is the best way to minimize the chance things can go wrong. Ensure you follow all steps in the FFF Prep section. Solutions to advanced issues are beyond the scope of this document. Find a 3D printing community, provide as much information about the problem as you can, and other enthusiasts will be happy to help.


Post-process

Post-process, or simply post, is very simple with FFF printers. It can be as simple as removing the print from the build plate, and avoid scratching the surface of the build plate while removing the print. Remove any supports that were also created for the proper construction of your print. 

Stereolithography

How it Works

SLA printers use UV resin and a UV LED panel to construct the model. UV resin hardens when exposed to UV light. UV resin, commonly known as just resin for short. SLA printers invert the model, with the build plate rising out of the vat as each layer is constructed. A vat is a wide, shallow container that holds the UV resin, with a FEP sheet as a transparent bottom that allows light to pass through and cure the UV resin. A FEP sheet is a specially engineered sheet of plastic specifically for resin printers.

Safety with SLA

Working with SLA printers, safety is more of a concern. Almost all resin is toxic to the human body, and precautions must be taken when touching or even breathing vapors. A respirator must be used. A respirator is a half-face or full-face breathing apparatus that makes the air safe to breathe. A respirator that uses organic vapor filter cartridges is required.

Gloves must also be worn. However, latex gloves will not work. Nitrile gloves must be used, and it must be a new pair each time resin is handled. Otherwise, the resin will breakdown the protection within the gloves, exposing you to the toxic effects. Repeated exposure can create an allergy to the resin, resulting in headaches, dizziness, vomiting, rashes at the site of exposure, and other unwanted effects.

Environmental Safety

During the printing process, resin is exposed to concentrated UV light, and quickly hardens. When resin is in its’ uncured form, it is quite hazardous to the environment, and extremely harmful to aquatic life. Paper towels, gloves, or solutions containing uncured resin - all of these items must be exposed to sunlight for a minimum of one hour before disposal. 


Printer Placement

Take care when choosing the room in which an SLA printer will reside. A print hood will block 99% of UV light. A print hood is a plastic shell from the manufacturer that comes with the printer. However, to fill the vat and retrieve the finished model from the printer, the hood must be removed. Indirect sunlight during this period will partially cure the resin, rendering it unusable for future printing, or it will cure on the model/build plate, and it will become extremely difficult to remove. 

The printer should also be placed in a well ventilated area, either outside or inside with ventilation, to avoid exposing others who do not wear safety gear. 

Preparation - Before Printing

A few things must be done before printing with SLA, similar to FFF. Place your model’s file into the slicer software of your choice, orient the model as desired, then slice the file. The slicer generates an instruction file. Load the sliced file onto an SD card, and insert that card into the printer. Clean the build plate with Isopropyl alcohol, commonly known as IPA, and wipe it with a clean, lint-free cloth. Resin printers have a bed that also functions as a build plate, and it does not need to level the build plate unless you suspect it has been disturbed during removal of a previous print. 

Troubleshooting

The construction of SLA printers leave few components available to modify. Still, keeping your SLA printer unmodified reduces the number of issues created.  Ensure you follow all steps in the SLA Prep section, and ensure you have selected a spot away from any sunlight. Solutions to advanced issues are beyond the scope of this document. Find a 3D printing community, provide as much information about the problem as you can, and other enthusiasts will be happy to help.

Post-Process

Post is quite a bit more involved with SLA. Remove the print from the build plate with a scraper, and avoid scratching the build plate while doing so. Remove any supports. After printing, a model will have uncured resin dripping from it. This must be removed, or it will cure with exposure to sunlight, and ruin the details on your print. To do this, the print must be placed in an ultrasonic cleaner and agitated in a solution of IPA. The print must then undergo a post-cure process. This post-cure consists of exposing the print to 10-15 minutes of additional UV light. The print then fully hardens, will no longer leech trace amounts of resin, and can be safely handled without gloves.

Build volumes vary between specific printers, however, FFF printers will always have a larger build volume for any price range. For example, my FFF printer has a build volume of 220x220x250mm. My SLA printer, purchased a year later for 50 dollars more, for the machine alone, has a much smaller build volume of 128x81x155mm. This is a 7.5x difference in total build volume. Other entry level brands will have different, but comparable build volumes. I purchased the SLA machine a year after the FFF machine. 

For SLA, safety and post-process equipment are mandatory, and should be factored into the total amount you will be spending. SLA requires a respirator rated for organic vapors, an ultrasonic cleaner for removing excess uncured resin from the print, and a UV LED panel to finish fully curing prints. 

FFF requires a bit of assembly, but SLA printers are a much more beginner friendly machine. FFF printers have videos of step by step walkthroughs on YouTube. SLA printers require little assembly. 

The best use for FFF printers are taking advantage of the build volume to produce large prints. SLA is capable of doing anything FFF can do, but in much higher detail, with little difference in the amount of work required for the post-process. 


Isopropyl Alcohol is needed for both types of printers, but FFF requires only a single spray to clean the build plate. SLA requires this as well, but it also requires filling the ultrasonic cleaner with IPA to clean your print. Set the IPA out in the sun for one hour in a clear bottle to cure the resin in the solution. Use a paper filter to remove the cured resin, then use the resin in the ultrasonic cleaner again. This process saves on IPA, but reduces the potency of the solution. Do the filter process a maximum of three times. After washing a print in the ultrasonic cleaner, examine it closely to determine if all of the resin has been removed. When buying IPA for an SLA printer, buy it in bulk. 

Recommendation
If you are still wary about making a decision, I will choose for you. Purchase the Ender 3 if you want an FFF printer. Purchase the Epax E6 if you want an SLA printer. I was a beginner when I started out, and these printers were more than adequate for my needs.
